MandelbrotFractals
==================

Desktop program to visually represent the Mandelbrot set fractals

These fractals generate themselves just by using a Math formula.
In this tool you can zoom a specific area of interest, change coordinates to move on the set, change precision of calculations (for a more detailed image), and finally you can save an image you like to keep.
